1.  Introduction

   The IETF, while focused on technical matters, is not neutral about
   the purpose of its work in developing the Internet [RFC3935]:

      The IETF community wants the Internet to succeed because we
      believe that the existence of the Internet, and its influence on
      economics, communication, and education, will help us to build a
      better human society.

   and, from the same document:

      The Internet isn't value-neutral, and neither is the IETF.  We
      want the Internet to be useful for communities that share our
      commitment to openness and fairness.  We embrace technical
      concepts such as decentralized control, edge-user empowerment and
      sharing of resources, because those concepts resonate with the
      core values of the IETF community.  These concepts have little to
      do with the technology that's possible, and much to do with the
      technology that we choose to create.

   However, the IETF is most comfortable making what we believe to be
   purely technical decisions; our process is defined to favor technical
   merit, through our well-known bias towards "rough consensus and
   running code".

   Nevertheless, the running code that results from our process (when
   things work well) inevitably has an impact beyond technical
   considerations, because the underlying decisions afford some uses
   while discouraging others; while we believe we are making purely
   technical decisions, in reality that may not be possible.  Or, in the
   words of Lawrence Lessig [CODELAW]:

      Ours is the age of cyberspace.  It, too, has a regulator... This
      regulator is code -- the software and hardware that make
      cyberspace as it is.  This code, or architecture, sets the terms
      on which life in cyberspace is experienced.  It determines how
      easy it is to protect privacy, or how easy it is to censor speech.
      It determines whether access to information is general or whether
      information is zoned.  It affects who sees what, or what is
      monitored.  In a host of ways that one cannot begin to see unless
      one begins to understand the nature of this code, the code of
      cyberspace regulates.

   This impact has become significant.  As the Internet increasingly
   mediates key functions in societies, it has unavoidably become
   profoundly political; it has helped people overthrow governments and
   revolutionize social orders, control populations and reveal secrets.
   It has created wealth for some individuals and companies, while
   destroying others'.

   This begs the question of what criteria are used when making
   decisions in the IETF; a technical meritorious proposal can and often
   does have profound effects - positive or negative - on various
   parties.

   Rather than develop principles internally - which the IETF has
   neither the expertise nor the mandate to do - it is more suitable to
   adopt externally-developed principles that are broadly perceived to
   be authoritative; namely, the United Nations' Universal Declaration
   of Human Rights [UDHR].

   To that end, this document:

   o  Mandates that human rights be given the same consideration as
      technical arguments in Section 2,

   o  identifies and encourages the development of further documentation
      to aid the application of human rights considerations to IETF work
      in Section 3, and

   o  establishes a Human Rights Review Directorate in Section 4.

2.  Considering Human Rights in IETF Decisions

   In IETF decisions, arguments supporting human rights are to be given
   the same consideration as technical arguments.

   Here, "IETF decisions" include those by Working Groups, Area
   Directors, the IESG as a whole and the IAB, and "human rights" are as
   defined by the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights
   [UDHR].

   In doing so, the IETF is acknowledging that human rights
   considerations are important to our work product, and that by
   extension that the UDHR is the recognised authoritative definition of
   them.

   This does not mean that human rights arguments automatically overcome
   technical considerations; just as with technical discussions, there
   are often subtleties to understand and tradeoffs to be made.

   It also does not require those making decisions to actively evaluate
   every proposal for human rights considerations; rather, it only
   requires that arguments motivated by human rights get equal
   consideration to technical arguments when they are brought to our
   attention.

3.  Developing Human Rights Guidance

   To help apply the policy in Section 2 the IETF will, from time to
   time, publish guidance outlining how specific human rights are
   applicable to IETF decisions.

   For example, Article 19 can be seen to be supported by existing
   advice on Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols [RFC6973],
   along with [RFC7258] (Pervasive Monitoring) and [RFC7754]
   (filtering).

4.  The Human Rights Review Directorate

   To support the policy in Section 2 and to develop the IETF's ability
   to align its work product with human rights, a Human Rights Review
   Directorate will be established.

   It is expected that the directorate's membership will:

   o  Review IETF documents that have potential impact on Human Rights

   o  Discuss the resulting issues with specification authors, Working
      Groups and other parties

   o  Hold face-to-face meetings at IETF meetings

   o  Create training material based upon the guidance outlined in
      Section 3, and present it at IETF meetings and elsewhere

   Members of the Directorate will be selected and overseen by the IETF
   Chair.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require action by IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not have direct security impact.
